[x] Longitude is never less than -124 but must be greater than -122 (-124 > x <= -122)
[x] Latitude is never more than 46 or less than 45 ( 46 > x >= 45)
[x] GPS_HDOP values >= 4 and < 23.1 are missing long/lat information
[x] The fewest number of GPS_SATELLITES is 0
[x] The most number of GPS_SATELLITES is 12
[x] Not all 0 GPS_SATELLITES are missing a lat/long
[x] 12 GPS_SATELLITES all have lat/long
[x] Every record has a activity time
[x] Every record has a meters entry
[ ] No bus should exceed 100 mph/160 kmh (this is easier since itâ€™s measured in meters!)
